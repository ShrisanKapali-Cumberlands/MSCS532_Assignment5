## Deterministic vs Randomized Quicksort

A list of arrays of sizes 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 7500, and 10000 were taken in sorted, reverse sorted, and random order. It was found that the randomized sort took the lowest time for all the distributions. The execution time for deterministic quicksort for sorted and reverse sorted grew exponentially. The worst case for deterministic quicksort time complexity is O(n^2), which aligns with deterministic quicksort's theoretical worst time complexity.
